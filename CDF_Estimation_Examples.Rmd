```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
```

By the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, 
$$
P\left( \sup_x \left | F(x) - \widehat{F}_n(x) \right | > \varepsilon \right) \leq 2 \exp( - 2n \varepsilon^2).
$$
If we substitute 
$$
  \varepsilon = \sqrt{}
$$

See the link https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_ecdf.html.

```{r}
n <- 1e2
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), 
                 y = pdf(rnorm))
ggplot(df, aes(x)) + stat_ecdf()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
